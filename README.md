Python-Practice
===============

a place where I practice python

find.py: A basic implementation of parts of the linux find command.  Supports file globbing, regular expression matching, and exact names.
	Also allows the user to choose only to list matches for directories or files

index.py: An exercise in creating a basic indexing system that find.py can use when available. It creates an index for each directory under the path specified.
