Python-Practice
===============

a place where I practice python

find.py: A basic implementation of parts of the linux find command.  Supports file globbing, regular expression matching, and exact names.
	Also allows the user to choose only to list matches for directories or files

find_packaged.py: At its essence, the same code as find.py, however this one is broken into functions for use with testing and imports.

index.py: An exercise in creating a basic indexing system that find.py can use when available. It creates an index for each directory under the path specified.

test_find.py: will eventually contain some tests to make sure that the find program returns the correct output.
